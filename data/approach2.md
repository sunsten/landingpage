The tools provide a data-driven overview of the blockchain space. Descriptive statistics offer a realistic picture of the size of the space, the various important players, and promising ways forward. Sunsten initially focuses on topics on blockchain technologies, however, it will broaden up its scope to provide tools that replicate the value they offer on blockchain technologies for other emerging technologies. At its core, Sunsten inspires to become a go-to place for rigorous and thought-through knowledge on regulatory, socio-economical, societal as well as other innate aspects of emerging technologies.
