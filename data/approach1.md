Sunsten offers tools for managers to assess their blockchain needs. These tools let them explore various industry sectors while highlighting misuses and misconceptions of blockchain technologies and thereby enable the assessment of possible new use-cases. Sunsten presents scenarios that favor blockchain technologies and delves into potential blockchain implementations. Hence, it reveals both the obvious and obscure adoption barriers that often hinder commercialization efforts and are often paid too little attention to. Whatâ€™s more, Sunsten is working on a classification system, with clear presentation of various governance models and their potential to improve existing business processes.
