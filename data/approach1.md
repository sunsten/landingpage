Sunsten offers tools to managers to assess their blockchain needs. These tools can be seen as vehicles to generate new use cases, to elaborate on existing use cases, and to discuss various misuses of and misconceptions around blockchain technologies. Married with the output of these tools, Sunsten highlights contexts that favor blockchain technologies, delves into attempts to implement blockchains, and some of the known obvious and obscure adoption barriers that can thwart commercialization efforts. What is more, classification and clear presentation of various governance models and their potential to improve existing business processes and create new businesses form a backbone of Sunsten.
